# Overview of the Game:
Our project, "Wild Serve," is a multiplayer Tennis Game that garners awareness towards the critical issue of animal poaching. This theme is reflected through the monkey and the bear as the two players in our game, and a hunter as the ball to showcase an ironic take on traditional poaching. Our game has similar premises as a pong game; each player will be able to move their character using the "W" and "S" keys for the monkey or "⬆︎" and "⬇︎" keys for the bear. The objective is to hit the ball to the other player without failing to catch it. We'll include a loading screen with the title of our game, and either user can press any key to start the game, as well as creating a score count system. Additionally, the visuals and fonts in our game will reflect similar jungle-aesthetics such as using specific colours and using more cartoon-like images to better demonstrate our theme, this reminded us of an early 2000s game, with a very simple and straight forward game.

# Themes
Essentially, a tennis game taking a ironic spin on animal poaching, making it a lighthearted game with a deep meaning.

# Aesthetic
Since our theme revolves around animal poaching, we found it fitting to implement a natural colour scheme. We did this by having wild animals as our characters and a background colour representative of the nature. While the game itself is a pong/tennis game, our background music exudes jungle vibes that add to the aesthetic we were aiming for.


# What we'd add:
With additional teaching and guidance, we would ensure that the music for our game works consistently. We attempted to do so but realized it only works occasionally, as the console shows an issue with its MIME type. We would've liked to have the ball not bounce off the walls, as it would've created a more realistic version of tennis, but after many attempts, it tended to change a significant portion of the functionality of the ball.

# Narratives
Our narrative includes the concept of animal cruelty, wanting to include the detrimental effect through how animals are hurt by poaching and use the game action "hitting the racet" as an analogy of their defence. Using the key colours like green are to highlight the atmosphere and environment of what animals should be in . According to the title "Wild Serve", putting a spin on real tennis rules to make them rough around the edges as they are animals. Through this narrative, we want to bring the game which also has an environment of green and nature through a tennis grid and using tennis as their fight. We used aesthetics involving gifs and sounds that are animated to fit to the game of tennis through animal.

# Issues along the way
While coding our game, we faced several issues. We had some difficulties moving the bear, monkey, and ball. With the bear and monkey, we found that the keys would not allow them to move up or down. Hence, Christina and Lucia had to create 'if statements' within the 'keyPressed' function and develop 'letTargetTile' statements within them. Furthermore, we struggled to fix the glitch when the ball collided with the players at specific angles. The serving system/point distribution was also tricky, but we managed it after several trials and some help from our workshop leader, Hugh. The end screen was also a challenge; however, Sara used her prior knowledge from last term to complete it.

## Group Members and Roles:
# Lucia:
Christina and I simultaneously worked on most parts of the code. Together with Sara, we conceptualised and implemented various aspects of the video game. We worked on creating the tile map and integrating Christina's grass background images, establishing their coordinates, and loading them onto the background canvas. Additionally, we developed multiplayer functionality and crafted the movement mechanics for the bear and monkey sprites. We ensured the ball spawned on the winner's side and refreshed upon hitting boundaries that we put into the code. Within our game, there was a glitch issue that whenever the ball would touch the player at an angle of its given tile. Hence I added the checkCollisionwithBall code. Christina and I came up and completed the tilemap, preload function, bear and monkey class (and their movability), tile class, update, music, finding all images for the game, and start screen.


# Christina:
For this project, I took part in developing the concept of the game, as well as the narrative behind it. I created the different textures for our code. I also coded the setup function of our game. Lucia and I simultaneously worked on the tilemap, preload function, bear and monkey class (and their movability), tile class, update, music, and start screen. In addition, I worked on the collision between the ball and the players, as well as the ball class. This includes making the ball move and go in random directions. 

# Sara:
 For this project, I helped devise the topic by collecting images we would use for the sprites. In terms of coding, I created the score count for the monkey and the bear and also contributed towards the creation of the sprites, constructors and KeyPressed sections. I also made the end screen where either winner would be displayed if they won 5 points in the game, as well as a loop that allowed the players to restart the game by pressing the spacebar.

# Rhea:
My role included desiging the mood board and adding image templates to the readme and inspiring the rest of the group with potential aesthetics for our game. Our theme involved ‘ a zoo’ and the detrimental effect on animals involving animal cruelty. Main colours I wanted our game to include were green and including a naturalistic outline. I also looked at how to design a ‘start game page’ that would efficiently work into starting the game which proggeseively move onto beginning the game and starting the levels perhaps, as well as compiling the mood board images.
